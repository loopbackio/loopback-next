# Spike on multiple copies of the same module providing typedefs

This directory contains a hypothetical app using (3rd party) components,
where some parts depend on different LoopBack version than others. The version
difference can be semver-major, e.g. an explorer component supporting multiple
LoopBack versions 2.x & 3.x; or semver-minor/patch, e.g. when the app fixates
the LoopBack version it wants to use.

IMPORTANT NOTE: This goal of this spike is to research how TypeScript type
system works when there are multiple copies of the same module around. It does
not follow the latest development on `master` branch.

## Hypotheses to test

- It is possible to have multiple definitions of the same Decorator function
  (see https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/decorators.html)

- It is possible to have multiple definitions of the same base class/interface

- Inheritance checks are strict, each definition with the same name is treated
  as a unique type

## Assumptions

- We will use decorators to annotate Controllers. These decorators will live
  in a small shared package (I call it "metadata" in this spike).
  Components are expected to depend on this package, similarly how the current
  connectors are depending on loopback-connector.

- Models and/or model Repositories will inherit from a base class provided
  by another shared package, I'll call it "model" in this spike.
  Components providing custom models are expected to depend on this package.

Directory layout:

- `package.json`
- `build.ts` - an automated build & test suite to verify all assumptions
- `metadata/` - the metadata package (source of truth)
- `metadata-v2/` - the metadata package, version 2 created from the original code
- `model/` - the base model & repository (source of truth)
- `model-v2/` - the base model & repository, version 2 created from the original code
- `component-controller` - a component providing a controller, using metadata-v1
- `component-model` - a component providing a model, using model-v1
- `app` - the app using the two components above, adding an own controller and
        model,.using v2 versions
