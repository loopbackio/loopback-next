# @loopback/core

LoopBack makes it easy to build modern applications that require complex
integrations.

# Overview

- Fast, small, powerful, extensible core
- Generate real APIs with a single command
- Define your data and endpoints with OpenAPI
- No maintenance of generated code


## Installation

```shell
$ npm install --save @loopback/core
```

## Basic Use

`@loopback/core` provides the foundation for your LoopBack app, but unlike
previous versions, it no longer contains the implementation for listening
servers.

For a typical example of how to create a REST server with your application,
see the [@loopback/rest package.](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next/tree/master/packages/rest)

## Advanced Use

Since `@loopback/core` is decoupled from the listening server implementation,
LoopBack applications are now able to work with any components that provide
this functionality.

```ts
// index.ts
import {Application} from '@loopback/core';
import {RestComponent} from '@loopback/rest';
import {GrpcComponent} from '@loopback/grpc';

const app = new Application({
  components: [
    RestComponent, // REST Server
    GrpcComponent, // GRPC Server
  ],
  rest: {
    port: 3000,
  },
  grpc: {
    port: 3001,
  },
});

(async function start() {
  // Let's retrieve the bound instances of our servers.
  const rest = await app.getServer('RestServer');
  const grpc = await app.getServer('GrpcServer');

  // Define all sorts of bindings here to pass configuration or data
  // between your server instances, define controllers and datasources for them,
  // etc...
  await app.start(); // This automatically spins up all your servers, too!
  console.log(`REST server running on port: ${rest.getSync('rest.port')}`);
  console.log(`GRPC server running on port: ${grpc.getSync('grpc.port')}`);
})();
```
In the above example, having a GRPC server mounted on your Application could
enable communication with other GRPC-enabled microservices, allowing things like
dynamic configuration updates.
