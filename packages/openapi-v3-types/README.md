# @loopback/openapi-v3-types

TypeScript type definitions for OpenAPI Spec/Swagger documents.

## Overview

TypeScript definitions describing the schema of OpenAPI/Swagger documents,
including LoopBack-specific extensions.

## Installation

```
$ npm install --save @loopback/openapi-v3-types
```

## Basic use

Use `OpenApiSpec` type in your function accepting an OpenAPI document:

```ts
import {OpenApiSpec} from '@loopback/openapi-v3-types';

export function validateSpec(spec: OpenApiSpec) {
  // ...

IDEs like Visual Studio Code will offer auto-completion for spec properties when
constructing a spec argument value.
