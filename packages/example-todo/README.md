## Overview

This tutorial demonstrates how to create a basic API for a todo list using
LoopBack 4.

## Setup

You'll need to make sure you have some things installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) at v8.x or greater

Additionally, this tutorial assumes that you are comfortable with certain

## Try it out

If you'd like to see the final results of this tutorial as an example
application, follow these steps:

1. Run the `lb4 example` command to select and clone the todo repository:
```sh
$ lb4 example

```

2. Jump into the directory and then install the required dependencies:
```sh
cd loopback4-example-todo && npm i
```

3. Finally, start the application!

    ```sh
    $ npm start

    Server is running on port 3000
    ```

Feel free to look around in the application's code to get a feel for how it
works, or if you're still interested in learning how to build it step-by-step,
