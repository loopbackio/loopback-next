### Create your app scaffolding

Install the `@loopback/cli` package. This will give you the command-line
toolkit that can generate a basic REST app for you.
`npm i -g @loopback/cli`

Next, navigate to whichever directory you'd like to create your new project
and run `lb4`. Follow the prompts to generate your application. For this
tutorial, when prompted with the options for selecting things like whether or
not to enable certain project features (loopback's build, tslint, mocha, etc.),
leave them all enabled.
