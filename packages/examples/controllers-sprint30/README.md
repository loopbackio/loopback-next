# Controllers and HTTP router: the first thin vertical slice

In Sprint 30, @bajtos will be working on the implementation of Decorators for defining Controllers,
and a HTTP router capable of handling requests using these controllers.

The subfolders step1 to step4 provide examples of Controllers, starting from the simplest to the most complex.

## What's next

 - How to define controllers without decorators
 - How to define controllers in ES6 using "class" keyword (and without decorators)
 - How to define controllers in ES5
