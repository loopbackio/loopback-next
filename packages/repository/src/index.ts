/**
 * A common set of interfaces for interacting with databases.
 *
 * @remarks
 * *NOTE:* This module is experimental and evolving. It is likely going to be
 * refactored and decomposed into multiple modules as we refine the story based
 * on the loopback-datasource-juggler and connector modules from LoopBack 3.x.
 *
 * This module provides data access facilities to various databases and services
 * as well as the constructs for modeling and accessing those data.
