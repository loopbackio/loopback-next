      description: Please provide a link to a Git repository or [Code Sandbox](https://githubbox.com/loopbackio/starter/tree/codesandbox) that can reproduce the problem you ran into. A **minimal reproduction** is required unless you are absolutely sure that the issue is obvious and the provided information is enough to understand the problem. If a report is vague (e.g. just a generic error message) and has no reproduction, it will receive a "need reproduction" label. If no reproduction is provided, the issue may be closed.
