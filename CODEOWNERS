# The list in this file serves two purposes:
# 1. It keeps track of Functional Area Owners, allowing all participants
#    to find which people to ping depending on the functional area involved.
# 2. It tells GitHub which maintainers to automatically assign for code reviews
#    of incoming pull requests.
#
# Lines starting with '#' are comments.
# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners,
# the last matching pattern has the most precedence.
#
# See https://help.github.com/articles/about-codeowners/
#
# IMPORTANT:
# Because the last matching pattern takes the most precedence, we need to list
# the functional areas from most generic (e.g. Models & Repositories) to most
# narrow (e.g. MongoDB).

# Fall-back entry for files not assigned to any Functional Areas
* @bajtos @raymondfeng

# To keep things simple, we don't assign any owners for the documentation.
# When some doc pages are changed as part of a pull request changing the
# implementation, then GitHub will assign the reviewers based on who is
# owning the code being modified.
# There will be no code owners assigned for pull requests changing
# the documentation only. We can improve this situation in the future,
# e.g. by re-organizing doc pages to align the file structure with functional
# areas.
