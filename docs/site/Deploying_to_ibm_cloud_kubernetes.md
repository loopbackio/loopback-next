## Overview

This tutorial shows how to deploy a [LoopBack4](http://v4.loopback.io/)
application onto [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io/) on the
[IBM Cloud](http://cloud.ibm.com).

## Prerequisite

You’ll need the following:

1. [Node.js 8.9 or higher](https://nodejs.org)
2. [Docker 18.06 or higher](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
3. [Sign up for an IBM Cloud account](https://cloud.ibm.com/) if you don't have
   one already.
4. [IBM Cloud CLI, Container registry CLI, etc](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli/index.html#overview)
5. [Kubernetes CLI (kubectl)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/overview/)
6. [LoopBack 4 CLI](https://v4.loopback.io/getting-started.html)

Let's install the LoopBack 4 CLI :

```
npm i -g @loopback/cli
```

After you have scaffolded a LoopBack4 application, you’ll get a default endpoint
/ping. For simplicity sake, we’ll use this.

## Step 1: Scaffold LoopBack 4 app

Run the `lb4 app` command, and specify all the values provided below.

```
$ lb4 app
? Project name: lb4-simple-web-app
? Project description: lb4-simple-web-app
? Project root directory: lb4-simple-web-app
? Application class name: Lb4SimpleWebAppApplication
? Select features to enable in the project (Press <space> to select, <a> to toggle all, <i> to invert selection)
 ◉ Enable tslint: add a linter with pre-configured lint rules
 ◉ Enable prettier: install prettier to format code conforming to rules
 ◉ Enable mocha: install mocha to run tests
 ◉ Enable loopbackBuild: use @loopback/build helpers (e.g. lb-tslint)
 ◉ Enable vscode: add VSCode config files
 ◉ Enable docker: include Dockerfile and .dockerignore
 ◉ Enable repositories: include repository imports and RepositoryMixin
 ◉ Enable services: include service-proxy imports and ServiceMixin
(Move up and down to reveal more choices)
```

The `lb4-simple-web-app` project is created.

Navigate to the main directory of the project

```
cd lb4-simple-web-app
```

## Step 2: Run the application locally

In a command window in the main directory of your project, type:

```
npm start
```

The application will build, and then the server should start up successfully and
display

```
Server is running at http://[::1]:3000
Try http://[::1]:3000/ping
```

Open your browser and attempt to access all these urls

<http://[::1]:3000/>

<http://[::1]:3000/ping>

<http://[::1]:3000/explorer>

<http://[::1]:3000/openapi.json>

![lb4_k8s_ibm_cloud_app_website_1.png](./imgs/lb4_k8s_ibm_cloud_app_website_1.png)

Make sure that the application runs well before continuing to the next step.

In the command window, stop the application with

```
Ctrl + C
```

## Step 3: Build a Docker image

Review the two Docker-related files that have been conveniently provided,
`.dockerignore` and `Dockerfile`, but leave them unchanged for this tutorial.

Notice the `HOST` and `PORT` environment variable values:

```
ENV HOST=0.0.0.0 PORT=3000
```

In the `package.json` file, a `docker:build` command has been provided.

```
"docker:build": "docker build -t lb4-simple-web-app ."
```

Run the command:

```
npm run docker:build
```

When it completes, you will see :

```
Successfully built 7d26df6c1561
Successfully tagged lb4-simple-web-app:latest
```

You can find your image by typing:

```
docker images | grep lb4-simple-web-app
```

It will display something like this :

```
lb4-simple-web-app   latest 7d26df6c1561
```

## Step 4: Run the application in Docker

In the `package.json` file, a `docker:run` command has been provided.

```
"docker:run": "docker run -p 3000:3000 -d lb4-simple-web-app"
```

Run the command:

```
npm run docker:run
```

Afterwards, type:

```
docker ps
```

You should see something like this:

```

CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                COMMAND          CREATED             STATUS         PORTS
a9962339e863   lb4-simple-web-app   "node ."         8 seconds ago       Up 7 seconds   0.0.0.0:3000->3000/tcp

```

To see the log output of your container, you can type:

```
docker logs <container id>    For example : a9962339e863
```

You should see something like:

```
Server is running at http://127.0.0.1:3000
Try http://127.0.0.1:3000/ping
```

Open your browser and attempt to access all these urls

<http://127.0.0.1:3000/>

<http://127.0.0.1:3000/ping>

<http://127.0.0.1:3000/explorer>

<http://127.0.0.1:3000/openapi.json>

## Step 5: Stop the application running in Docker

Find the container id

```
docker ps | grep lb4
```

You should see something like this:

```
a9962339e863        lb4-simple-web-app      "node ."
```

The leftmost value is the container id.

Type:

```
docker stop <container id>         For example : a9962339e863
```

## Step 6: Log into IBM Cloud using ibmcloud login command

Use `ibmcloud login` command to login.

{% include tip.html content="Since I’m using a federated user id (IBMid), I use <b>ibmcloud login --sso</b> to login." %}

After you’ve been successfully logged in, you’ll see something like:

```
API endpoint:      https://api.ng.bluemix.net
Region:            us-south
User:              dremond@ca.ibm.com
Account:           Dominique Emond's Account
Resource group:    default
CF API endpoint:
Org:
Space:
```

## Step 7: Log into IBM Cloud Container Registry

```
ibmcloud cr login
```

You should see:

```
Logging in to 'registry.ng.bluemix.net'...
Logged in to 'registry.ng.bluemix.net'.
OK
```

## Step 8: Upload a docker image to the Container Registry

This requires several steps, let's quickly go through them.

### Create a namespace

List your current namespace by typing:

```
ibmcloud cr namespace-list
```

If you want to create a new namespace for yourself, you can do so with this
command:

```
ibmcloud cr namespace-add <my_namespace>
```

{% include tip.html content="I will be using my namespace <b>dremond</b> in the commands that follow." %}

### Tag your local docker image with the IBM Cloud container registry

Here is the command:

```
docker tag <source_image>:<tag> registry.<region>.bluemix.net/<my_namespace>/<new_image_repo>:<new_tag>
```

`<source_image>:<tag>` is what you have on your machine that you created
earlier.

For example : `lb4-simple-web-app:latest`

`registry.<region>.bluemix.net` is the container registry region you logged into
before.

For example : `registry.ng.bluemix.net`

`<my_namespace>` is the namespace you created for yourself

For example : `dremond`

`<new_image_repo>:<new_tag>` can be whatever you want it to be; they don't have
to exist yet

For example : `loopback4_webapp_repo:1`

So, putting these values together, my command will look like this:

```
docker tag lb4-simple-web-app:latest registry.ng.bluemix.net/dremond/loopback4_webapp_repo:1
```

### Push the local image to the container registry

```
docker push registry.ng.bluemix.net/dremond/loopback4_webapp_repo:1
```

You will see a progress bar like this:

```
The push refers to repository [registry.ng.bluemix.net/dremond/loopback4_webapp_repo]
478b1e842aa3: Pushed
6fd2223ea65e: Pushed
a90c4aba186a: Pushing [============>                                      ]   51.4MB/207.9MB
bb288a38c607: Pushed
53981d6ec3d2: Mounted from dremond/loopback4_repo
b727cac390f6: Mounted fro
```

Wait until it is completed.

```

```

### Verify the image is in the container registry

Type the command :

```
ibmcloud cr image-list
```

You should see your image listed.

![lb4_k8s_ibm_cloud_container_registry_1.png](./imgs/lb4_k8s_ibm_cloud_container_registry_1.png)

{% include tip.html content="One important column is the last one on the right <b>'Security Status'</b>. Initially it will have a value of <b>'Scanning...'</b> . Wait until the scanning is complete. My image has a <b>'No Issues'</b> status. This is good. If it instead stated <b>'9 Issues'</b> (in red), then I would need to take some extra steps later on in my account to view the issues, figure out a way to resolve them, or create an Exemption for them. <a href='https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/va/va_index.html#va_index'>Managing image security with Vulnerability Advisor</a>" %}

### Perform a build for the container registry

Perform a build for the container registry.

```
ibmcloud cr build -t registry.ng.bluemix.net/dremond/loopback4_webapp_repo:1 .
```

{% include tip.html content="Don't forget the trailing period...it won't work without it." %}

This step may fail if you have exceeded the QUOTA for images in your account. In
that case clear up some room and try again.

Wait until it completes.

In your IBM Cloud account, you can view your images
[here](https://cloud.ibm.com/containers-kubernetes/registry/main/images).

## Step 9: Point to your Kubernetes Cluster

In a browser, log into your IBM Cloud account, and navigate to **Kubernetes >
Clusters**.

![lb4_k8s_ibm_cloud_kubernetes_cluster_1.png](./imgs/lb4_k8s_ibm_cloud_kubernetes_cluster_1.png)

I am choosing my cluster `dremondOne` in Dallas .

( If you do not have a Kubernetes cluster, you can create one for free by going
to <https://cloud.ibm.com/containers-kubernetes/overview> , clicking on the
`'Create a cluster'` button, specifying a Resource Group of `'default'`, a
Location of `'Dallas'`, choosing a Cluster Type of `'Free'`, and giving it a
name. )

Select the **'Access'** tab of your cluster and follow the instructions.

![lb4_k8s_ibm_cloud_cluster_access_1.png](./imgs/lb4_k8s_ibm_cloud_cluster_access_1.png)

We already logged into the IBM Cloud in an earlier step, so we only need to
point to the cluster.

```
ibmcloud cs region-set us-south
```

```
ibmcloud cs cluster-config <Cluster Name>
```

My cluster name is **'dremondOne'** so I see this output:

```
OK
The configuration for dremondOne was downloaded successfully. Export environment variables to start using Kubernetes.

export KUBECONFIG=/Users/dremond/.bluemix/plugins/container-service/clusters/dremondOne/kube-config-hou02-dremondOne.yml
```

Take the entire **'export'** line above, and paste it into your command window.

Now you should be able to perform Kubernetes commands like:

```
kubectl get nodes
```

You will see output like this:

```
NAME           STATUS    ROLES     AGE       VERSION
10.76.193.58   Ready     <none>    13d       v1.10.8+IKS
```

Ok, so now we are ready to deploy our Loopback4 application to Kubernetes!

## Step 10: Deploy your Loopback4 application to Kubernetes

### Create a deployment

Create a deployment named : lb4-simple-web-app-deployment ; using the image we
placed in the container registry.

```
kubectl run lb4-simple-web-app-deployment --image=registry.ng.bluemix.net/dremond/loopback4_webapp_repo:1
```

### Verify that the pods are running

```
kubectl get pods
```

You should see

```
NAME                                             READY     STATUS             RESTARTS   AGE
lb4-simple-web-app-deployment-5bfcb546d8-r7cs4   1/1       Running            0          7m
```

A status of **'Running'** is a good sign. If you have anything other than this,
then there may be something wrong with your docker image , or it may have
vulnerability issues you need to address.

To see the logs of your pod, type:

```
kubectl logs lb4-simple-web-app-deployment-5bfcb546d8-r7cs4
```

and you will see something like this:

```
Server is running at http://127.0.0.1:3000
Try http://127.0.0.1:3000/ping
```

### Create a service

Expose your deployment with a service named : lb4-simple-web-app-service

```
kubectl expose deployment/lb4-simple-web-app-deployment --type=NodePort --port=3000 --name=lb4-simple-web-app-service --target-port=3000
```

### Obtain the NodePort of your service

Let's determine the NodePort of your service.

```
kubectl describe service lb4-simple-web-app-service
```

You will see output like this:

```
Name:                     lb4-simple-web-app-service
Namespace:                default
Labels:                   run=lb4-simple-web-app-deployment
Annotations:              <none>
Selector:                 run=lb4-simple-web-app-deployment
Type:                     NodePort
IP:                       172.21.103.26
Port:                     <unset>  3000/TCP
TargetPort:               3000/TCP
NodePort:                 <unset>  31701/TCP
Endpoints:                172.30.78.136:3000
Session Affinity:         None
External Traffic Policy:  Cluster
Events:                   <none>
```

In this case, the NodePort is 31701 .

### Obtain the public IP address of the cluster

Let's determine the public IP address of the cluster

```
ibmcloud ks workers dremondOne
```

You should see something like this

```
OK
ID                        Public IP       Private IP     Machine Type   State    Status
kube-hou02-pa45e...6-w1   184.173.5.187   10.76.193.58   free           normal   Ready

```

In my case, the public IP is: 184.173.5.187

So now we can formulate the url of our loopback4 application using those two
pieces :

```
http://184.173.5.187:31701
```

Open your browser and attempt to access all these urls

```
http://184.173.5.187:31701/

http://184.173.5.187:31701/ping

http://184.173.5.187:31701/explorer

http://184.173.5.187:31701/openapi.json
```

![lb4_k8s_ibm_cloud_app_website_on_cloud_k8s.png](./imgs/lb4_k8s_ibm_cloud_app_website_on_cloud_k8s.png)

## Step 11: View your app in the Kubernetes Dashboard

Let's go take a look at your application in the Kubernetes dashboard.

Click the **'Kubernetes Dashboard'** button next to your cluster's name.

![lb4_k8s_ibm_cloud_k8s_dashboard_1.png](./imgs/lb4_k8s_ibm_cloud_k8s_dashboard_1.png)

Under **'Workloads'**, select **'Pods'**

![lb4_k8s_ibm_cloud_k8s_dashboard_2.png](./imgs/lb4_k8s_ibm_cloud_k8s_dashboard_2.png)

Locate your application, and click on its name

![lb4_k8s_ibm_cloud_k8s_dashboard_3.png](./imgs/lb4_k8s_ibm_cloud_k8s_dashboard_3.png)

If you want to open a shell into the container in the pod, click on the `EXEC`
button.

If you want to view the logs of the container in the pod, click on the `LOGS`
button.

![lb4_k8s_ibm_cloud_k8s_dashboard_4.png](./imgs/lb4_k8s_ibm_cloud_k8s_dashboard_4.png)

So there you have it! You have successfully deployed a Loopback4 application to
Kubernetes on the IBM Cloud.
