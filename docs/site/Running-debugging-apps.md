In general, when you are developing an application, use the `npm` command to run
it. This enables you to see stack traces and console output immediately.

For example:

```
$ cd myapp
$ npm start
```

LoopBack 4 also allows you to specify debug strings that the application will
display to the console (or save to a file) to help you verify or diagnose the
app. SeeÂ [Setting debug strings](Setting-debug-strings.md).
