### Synopsis

The `lb4 copyright` command runs inside a Node.js project with `package.json` to
add or update copyright/license header for JavaScript and TypeScript files based
on `package.json` and git history.

The command also supports [lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna) monorepos. It
traverses all packages within the monorepo and apply copyright/license headers.

```sh
lb4 copyright [options]
```

The following is an example of such headers.

```js
// Copyright IBM Corp. 2020. All Rights Reserved.
// Node module: @loopback/cli
// This file is licensed under the MIT License.
// License text available at https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT
```

The year(s) is built from the git history of the file and `Node module` is read
from the `name` property in `package.json`.

Please note the command expects `git` is installed.

### Options

`--owner` : _(Optional)_ The owner of the copyright, such as `IBM Corp.`.

`--license` : _(Optional)_ The name of the license, such as `MIT`.

`--gitOnly` : _(Optional)_ A flag to control if only git tracked files are
updated. Default to `true`.

### Interactive Prompts

The command prompts you for:

1. The copyright owner. The default value is read from `copyright.owner` or
   `author` in the `package.json`.

2. The license name. The default value is read from `license` in the
   `package.json`.

The default owner is `IBM Corp.` and license is `MIT` with the following
`package.json`.

```json
{
  "name": "@loopback/boot",
  "version": "2.0.2",
  "author": "IBM Corp.",
  "copyright.owner": "IBM Corp.",
  "license": "MIT"
}
```
