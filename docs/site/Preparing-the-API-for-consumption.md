## Preparing your API for consumption

### Interacting with your API

We'll use the repo
[loopback4-example-getting-started](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback4-example-getting-started)
to demonstrate how Swagger UI can be used to test your endpoints.

First, git clone the repository, install its dependencies, and run the
application:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/strongloop/loopback4-example-getting-started
$ cd loopback4-example-getting-started
$ npm i
$ npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000/swagger-ui](http://localhost:3000/swagger-ui) to see
the API endpoints defined by `swagger.json`.

{% include note.html content=" Swagger UI provides users with interactive
environment to test the API endpoints defined by the raw spec found at
[http://localhost:3000/openapi.json](http://localhost:3000/openapi.json). The
API spec is also available in YAML flavour at
[http://localhost:3000/openapi.yaml](http://localhost:3000/openapi.yaml) " %}

{% include image.html file="lb4/10000000.png" alt="" %}

The Swagger UI displays all of the endpoints defined in your application.

{% include image.html file="lb4/10000001.png" alt="" %}

Clicking on one of the endpoints will show the endpoint's documentation as
defined in your API spec. Next, click on `Try It Out` to send a request to the
endpoint. If the endpoint takes parameters, assign the values before the request
is sent. If the parameter involves a body, a template is given for you to edit
as specified in your spec. Click `Execute` to send the request:

{% include image.html file="lb4/10000002.png" alt="" %}

The response to the request can be seen below the `Execute` button, where the
response code and the body are displayed. Ideally, each endpoint should be
tested with good and bad inputs to confirm that the returned responses are as
expected.

## Closing thoughts

Congratulations! You now have successfully created and tested an API with
LoopBack 4. We hope you enjoy the test-drive. Your feedback matters and please
share your thoughts with us.

This is just the beginning of the full LoopBack 4 developer experience. The
first beta release lays out the new foundation of LoopBack for extension
developers. It also demonstrates a path to create REST APIs from OpenAPI specs
together with Controllers and Repositories. More features will be added in the
coming weeks and months.
