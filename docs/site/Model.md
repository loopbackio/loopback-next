## Overview

A `model` represents the definition of a model in LoopBack, with respect to the
[datasource juggler](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-datasource-juggler).
Currently, we provide the `@loopback/repository` module, which provides special
decorators for adding metadata to your TypeScript/JavaScript classes in order to
use them with the legacy implementation of the Juggler.

## Definition of a Model

At its core, a model in LoopBack is a simple JavaScript class.

```ts
export class Customer {
  email: string;
  isMember: boolean;
  cart: ShoppingCart;
}
```

Extensibility is a core feature of LoopBack. There are external packages that
add additional features, for example, integration with the legacy juggler or
JSON Schema generation. These features become available to a LoopBack model
through the ~~usage of~~ `@model` and `@property` decorators from the
`@loopback/repository` module.

```ts
import {model, property} from '@loopback/repository';

@model()
export class Customer {
  @property() email: string;
  @property() isMember: boolean;
  @property() cart: ShoppingCart;
}
```

## Using Legacy Juggler

To define a model for use with the legacy juggler, extend your classes from
`Entity` and decorate them with the `@model` and `@property` decorators.

```ts
import {model, property} from '@loopback/repository';

@model()
export class Product extends Entity {
  @property({
    id: true,
    description: 'The unique identifier for a product',
  })
  id: number;

  @property() name: string;

  @property() slug: string;

  constructor(data?: Partial<Product>) {
    super(data);
  }
}
```

### Model Decorator

The model decorator can be used without any additional parameters, or can be
passed in a

<!-- should be replaced with a lb4 example when possible -->

[ModelDefinitionSyntax](https://loopback.io/doc/en/lb3/Model-definition-JSON-file.html)
object which follows the general format provided in LoopBack 3:

```ts
@model({
  name: 'Category',
  properties: {
    // define properties here.
  },
  settings: {
    // etc...
  },
})
class Category extends Entity {
  // etc...
}
```

However, the model decorator already knows the name of your model class, so you
can omit it.

```ts
@model()
class Product extends Entity {
  name: string;
  // other properties...
}
```

Additionally, the model decorator is able to build the properties object through
the information passed in or inferred by the property decorators, so the
properties key value pair can be omitted as well by using property decorators.

### Property Decorator

The property decorator takes in the same arguments used in LoopBack 3 for
individual property entries:

```ts
@model()
class Product extends Entity {
  @property({
    name: 'name',
    description: "The product's common name.",
    type: 'string',
  })
  public name: string;
}
```

The complete list of valid attributes for property definitions can be found in
LoopBack 3's
[Model definition section](https://loopback.io/doc/en/lb3/Model-definition-JSON-file.md#properties)

<!-- NOTE(kjdelisle): Until we have a metadata docs section, link to the
package in the repository. -->

The property decorator leverages LoopBack's
[metadata package](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next/tree/master/packages/metadata)
to determine the type of a particular property.

```ts
@model()
class Product extends Entity {
  @property() public name: string; // The type information for this property is String.
}
```

### Array Property Decorator

There is a limitation to the metadata that can be automatically inferred by
LoopBack, due to the nature of arrays in JavaScript. In JavaScript, arrays do
not possess any information about the types of their members. By traversing an
array, you can inspect the members of an array to determine if they are of a
primitive type (string, number, array, boolean), object or function, but this
would not tell us anything about what the value would be if it were an object or
function.

For consistency, we require the use of the `@property.array` decorator, which
adds the appropriate metadata for type inference of your array properties.

```ts
@model()
class Order extends Entity {
  @property.array(Product) items: Product[];
}

@model()
class Thread extends Entity {
  // Note that we still require it, even for primitive types!
  @property.array(String) posts: string[];
}
```

Additionally, the `@property.array` decorator can still take an optional 2nd
parameter to define or override metadata in the same fashion as the `@property`
decorator.

```ts
@model()
class Customer extends Entity {
  @property.array(String, {
    name: 'names',
    required: true,
  })
  aliases: string[];
}
```

### JSON Schema inference

Use the `@loopback/repository-json-schema module` to build a JSON schema from a
decorated model. Type information is inferred from the `@model` and `@property`
decorators. The `@loopback/repository-json-schema` module contains the
`getJsonSchema` function to access the metadata stored by the decorators to
build a matching JSON Schema of your model.

```ts
import {model, property} from '@loopback/repository';
import {getJsonSchema} from '@loopback/repository-json-schema';

@model()
class Category {
  @property() name: string;
}

@model()
class Product {
  @property({required: true})
  name: string;
  @property() type: Category;
}

const jsonSchema = getJsonSchema(Product);
```

`jsonSchema` from above would return:

```json
{
  "title": "Product",
  "properties": {
    "name": {
      "type": "string"
    },
    "type": {
      "$ref": "#/definitions/Category"
    }
  },
  "definitions": {
    "Category": {
      "properties": {
        "name": {
          "type": "string"
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "required": ["name"]
}
```

If a custom type is specified for a decorated property in a model definition,
then a reference
[`$ref`](http://json-schema.org/latest/json-schema-core.html#rfc.section.8)
field is created for it and a `definitions` sub-schema is created at the
top-level of the schema. The `definitions` sub-schema is populated with the type
definition by recursively calling `getJsonSchema` to build its properties. This
allows for complex and nested custom type definition building. The example above
illustrates this point by having the custom type `Category` as a property of our
`Product` model definition.

#### Supported JSON keywords

{% include note.html content="

This feature is still a work in progress and is incomplete.

Following are the supported keywords that can be explicitly passed into the
decorators to better tailor towards the JSON Schema being produced.

| Keywords    | Decorator   | Type    | Default      | Description                                             |
| ----------- | ----------- | ------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| title       | `@model`    | string  | _model name_ | Name of the model                                       |
| description | `@model`    | string  |              | Description of the model                                |
| array       | `@property` | boolean |              | Used to specify whether the property is an array or not |
| required    | `@property` | boolean |              | Used to specify whether the property is required or not |

## Other ORMs

You might decide to use an alternative ORM/ODM in your LoopBack application.
Loopback v4 no longer expects you to provide your data in its own custom Model
format for routing purposes, which means you are free to alter your classes to
suit these ORMs/ODMs.

However, this also means that the provided schema decorators will serve no
purpose for these ORMs/ODMs. Some of these frameworks may also provide
decorators with conflicting names (ex. another `@model` decorator), which might
warrant avoiding the provided juggler decorators.
