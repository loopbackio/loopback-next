## Overview

In LoopBack, auto-migration helps the user create relational database schemas
based on definitions of their models. Auto-migration can facilitate the
synchronization of the backing database and models so that they match, such as
in cases where the database needs to be changed in order to match the models.
LoopBack offers two ways to do this:

- **Auto-migrate**: Drop schema objects if they already exist and re-create them
  based on model definitions. Existing data will be lost.

- **Auto-update**: Change database schema objects if there is a difference
  between the objects and model definitions. Existing data will be kept.

For connector-specific settings for defining model schemas and auto-migration,
check out the specific connector under
[Database Connectors](Database-connectors.md).

{% include warning.html content="Auto-update will attempt to preserve data while
updating the schema in your target database, but this is not guaranteed to be
safe.

Please check the documentation for your specific connector(s) for a detailed
breakdown of behaviors for auto-migrate! " %}

## Examples

LoopBack applications are typically using `RepositoryMixin` to enhance the core
`Application` class with additional repository-related APIs. One of such methods
is `migrateSchema`, which iterates over all registered datasources and asks them
to migrate schema of models they are backing. Datasources that do not support
schema migrations are silently skipped.

In the future, we would like to provide finer-grained control of database schema
updates, learn more in the GitHub issue
[#487 Database Migration Management Framework](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next/issues/487)

### Auto-update database at start

To automatically update the database schema whenever the application is started,
modify your main script to execute `app.migrateSchema()` after the application
was bootstrapped (all repositories were registered) but before it is actually
started.

{% include code-caption.html content="src/index.ts" %}

```ts
export async function main(options: ApplicationConfig = {}) {
  const app = new TodoListApplication(options);
  await app.boot();
  await app.migrateSchema();
  await app.start();

  const url = app.restServer.url;
  console.log(`Server is running at ${url}`);

  return app;
}
```

### Auto-update the database explicitly

It's usually better to have more control about the database migration and
trigger the updates explicitly. To do so, projects scaffolded using `lb4 app`
come with a custom CLI script `src/migrate.ts` to run schema migration. Check
out e.g.
[Todo example app](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next/blob/master/examples/todo/src/migrate.ts)
to see the full source code of the script.

Besides the migration CLI, new projects come with a handy npm script to run the
migration too.

The migration process consists of two steps now:

1. Build the project:

   ```sh
   $ npm run build
   ```

2. Migrate database schemas (alter existing tables):

   ```sh
   $ npm run migrate
   ```

   Alternatively, you can also tell the migration script to drop any existing
   schemas:

   ```sh
   $ npm run migrate -- --rebuild
   ```

### Implement additional migration steps

In some scenarios, the application may need to define additional schema
constraints or seed the database with predefined model instances. This can be
achieved by overriding the `migrateSchema` method provided by the mixin.

The example below shows how to do so in our Todo example application.

{% include code-caption.html content="src/application.ts" %}

```ts
import {TodoRepository} from './repositories';
// skipped: other imports

export class TodoListApplication extends BootMixin(
  ServiceMixin(RepositoryMixin(RestApplication)),
) {
  // skipped: the constructor, etc.

  async migrateSchema(options?: SchemaMigrationOptions) {
    // 1. Run migration scripts provided by connectors
    await super.migrateSchema(options);

    // 2. Make further changes. When creating predefined model instances,
    // handle the case when these instances already exist.
    const todoRepo = await this.getRepository(TodoRepository);
    const found = await todoRepo.findOne({where: {title: 'welcome'}});
    if (found) {
      todoRepo.updateById(found.id, {isComplete: false});
    } else {
      await todoRepo.create({title: 'welcome', isComplete: false});
    }
  }
}
```
