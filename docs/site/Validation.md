Within a LoopBack application, validation can be added in various places
depending on the usage. Some types of validations come out-of-the-box in
LoopBack, such as type validation in the REST layer, whereas some require
additional configuration or code.

There are various types of validations such as:

- validation of input/output for method invocations
- validation of model instance properties, for example, age < 0
- validation of model collections, for example, uniqueness

Let's take a closer look at how validation can be added in the following layers:

- [REST layer](Validation-REST-layer.md)
- [Controller, Repository and Service Layer](Validation-controller-layer.md)
- [ORM layer](Validation-ORM-layer.md)

The
[validation-app example application](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next/blob/master/examples/validation-app)
is used in the following documentation pages for demonstration. In the example,
a `CoffeeShop` model is being used. It has the following properties.

| Property name |  Type  | Description                           |
| ------------- | :----: | ------------------------------------- |
| shopId        | string | ID of the coffee shop                 |
| city          | string | City where the coffee shop is located |
| phoneNum      | string | Phone number of the coffee shop       |
| capacity      | number | Capacity of the coffee shop           |
