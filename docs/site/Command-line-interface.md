LoopBack 4 provides command-line tools to help you get started quickly. The command line tools generate application and extension projects and install their dependencies for you.
The CLI can also help you generate artifacts, such as controllers, for your projects.
Once generated, the scaffold can be expanded with users' own code as needed.

To use LoopBack 4's CLI, run this command:

```
npm install -g @loopback/cli
```
