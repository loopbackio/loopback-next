### Synopsis

Downloads a LoopBack example project from our
[GitHub monorepo](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next).

```text
lb4 example [options] [<example-name>]
```

### Options

{% include_relative includes/CLI-std-options.md %}

### Arguments

`example-name` - Optional name of the example to clone. If provided, the tool
will skip the example-name prompt and run in a non-interactive mode.

See [Examples](Examples.md) and [Tutorials](Tutorials.md) for the list of
available examples.

### Interactive Prompts

The tool will prompt you for:

- Name of the example to download. If the name had been supplied from the
  command-line, the prompt is skipped.

### Output

The example project is downloaded to a new directory and its dependencies are
installed. For example, when downloading `todo` example, the tool stores the
files under the newly created `loopback4-example-todo` directory.
