{% include important.html content="LoopBack 4 is the next step in the evolution
of LoopBack. It is still in early development and is not yet released. " %}

{% include see-also.html title="GitHub Repo" content=' LoopBack 4 framework code
is being developed in one "mono-repository",
[loopback-next](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next), rather than
multiple repos, as in v3. However, examples and externally-developed components
will be in separate repositories. '%}

## Built for API developers

- Define your API endpoints and schemas using the
  [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/) standard.
- Write your endpoints in modern JavaScript using ES2017, `async` / `await`,
  modules.
- Use your defined endpoints and schemas as the source of truth without
  generating code.

## Built for teams

- Review changes to API endpoints without digging through JavaScript.
- Maintain consistency by automating the validation of your endpoints and
  schemas.
- First class support for [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) (strongly
  typed JavaScript).

## Built for your platform

- Use LoopBack as a starting point for your own framework or platform.
- Build libraries of reusable components in a standardized way.
- Integrate with databases, web services, and other platforms using connectors.
