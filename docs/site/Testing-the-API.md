## Smoke test API input/output

Once you confirm that the API specification is valid, it's time to verify that the application implements the API as you have specified it.  The input/output testing described below uses [Dredd](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dredd), specifically `hello-world` in this section.  Concrete sample code of `hello-world` can be found in the [hello-world tutorial](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next-hello-world) repository.  Although the sample code includes a validated API spec and fully functional `hello-world` controller, let's pretend the controller is completely empty.  Try it yourself by cloning the repository from GitHub.

For input/output testing, you are going to create three parts:
1. Input data definition.
2. Expected output response definition.
3. Test code.

Parts one and two are included in the API specification.  The input data is given as `x-example` as follows:

```js
"x-example": "Ted"
```

The expected output as `examples`:

```js
"examples": {
  "text/plain": "Hello world Ted."
}
```

The `Dredd` module reserves `x-example` to set the input parameter.  the OpenAPI standard defines the [`examples` object](https://swagger.io/specification/#examples-object-92) as a map from `MIME type` to the content value.  Here, it's `text/plain` MIME type.  As you see, they are a pair: When you change the input value `x-example`, you must change `examples` value as well.

The complete `hello-world` API specification is the following:

```js
export const controllerSpec =
{
  swagger: '2.0',
  basePath: '/',
  info: {
    title: 'LoopBack Application',
    version: '1.0.0',
  },
  "paths": {
    "/helloworld": {
      "get": {
        "x-operation-name": "helloWorld",
        "parameters": [
          {
            "name": "name",
            "in": "query",
            "description": "Your name.",
            "required": false,
            "type": "string",
            "x-example": "Ted"
          }
        ],
        "responses": {
          "200": {
            "description": "Returns a hello world with your (optional) name.",
            "examples": {
              "text/plain": "Hello world Ted."
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The third piece is the test code.  To initialize the test environment, you need to create a `Dredd` instance specifying the configuration. There are two required fields in the configuration object: `server` and `options.path`.
 `localhostAndPort + \'/swagger.json\'` is the predefined end point LoopBack 4 uses for the client to access the API specification of the service API.

```js
  async function initEnvironment() {
    // By default, the port is set to 3000.
    const app: Application = new HelloWorldApp();
    const server = app.getServer(RestServer);
    // For testing, you'll let the OS pick an available port by setting
    // RestBindings.PORT to 0.
    server.bind(RestBindings.PORT).to(0);
    // app.start() starts up the HTTP server and binds the acquired port
    // number to RestBindings.PORT.
    await app.start();
    // Get the real port number.
    const port: number = await server.get(RestBindings.PORT);
    const localhostAndPort: string = 'http://localhost:' + port;
    const config: object = {
      server: localhostAndPort, // base path to the end points
      options: {
        level: 'fail', // report 'fail' case only
        silent: false, // false for helpful debugging info
        path: [localhostAndPort + '/swagger.json'], // to download apiSpec from the service
      }
    };
    dredd = new Dredd(config);
  }
```

Since the specification above includes definition of input data and the expected output, you have all the pieces to write the test code:

```js
describe('Api Spec End Points', () => {
  let dredd: any;
  before(initEnvironment);

  describe('input/output test', () => {

    it('passes match', done => {
      dredd.run((err: Error, stats: object) => {
        if (err) return done(err);
        expect(stats).to.containDeep({
          failures: 0,
          errors: 0,
          skipped: 0,
        });
        done();
      });
    });
  });

  async function initEnvironment() {
    //
    // see initEnvironment defined above.
    //
  });
})
```

Try running the first test:

```shell
$ npm test

  Api Spec End Points
    input/output test
fail: GET /helloworld?name=Ted duration: 26ms
fail: body: Real and expected data does not match.

request:
method: GET
uri: /helloworld?name=Ted
headers:
    User-Agent: Dredd/4.3.0 (Darwin 16.7.0; x64)
    Content-Length: 0
body:

expected:
headers:
    Content-Type: text/plain
body:
Hello world Ted
statusCode: 200

actual:
statusCode: 500
headers:
    date: Wed, 23 Aug 2017 00:17:48 GMT
    connection: close
    content-length: 0
body:

complete: 0 passing, 1 failing, 0 errors, 0 skipped, 1 total
complete: Tests took 27ms
```

The test report correctly shows that the input is `name=Ted` and the expected result is `Hello world Ted`, but the actual result was `statusCode: 500` which does not match the expectation.  When the `hello-world` API is implemented, the result would be something like the following:

```shell
$ npm test

  Api Spec End Points
    input/output test
complete: 1 passing, 0 failing, 0 errors, 0 skipped, 1 total
complete: Tests took 21ms
```

It's a powerful proposition to use the API specification not only for API declaration but for test case declaration.  The discussion so far paves the road to "automated controller wireframe-code generation and test-driven development" based on the OpenAPI standard.

At this point, you are ready to make these tests pass by coding up your business logic.
