# Contributing to LoopBack

Contributions to LoopBack include code, documentation, answering user questions,
and advocating for all types of LoopBack users. See our official documentation
on loopback.io for more information common to all of our GitHub repositories:

## [Principles](http://loopback.io/doc/en/contrib/Governance.html#principles)

LoopBack is an open, inclusive, and tolerant community of people working
together to build a world-class Node framework and tools. We value diversity of
individuals and opinions, and seek to operate on consensus whenever possible. We
strive to maintain a welcoming, inclusive, and harassment-free environment,
regardless of the form of communication. When consensus is not achievable, we
defer to the owners of each individual module; the powers of the individual
owner are kept in check by the ability of the community to fork and replace
dependencies on the individual module and maintainer.

The LoopBack project adopts the
[Contributor Covenant version 2](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## [Reporting issues](http://loopback.io/doc/en/contrib/Reporting-issues.html)
