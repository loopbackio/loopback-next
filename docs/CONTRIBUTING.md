## [Principles](http://loopback.io/doc/en/contrib/Governance.html#principles)

LoopBack is an open, inclusive, and tolerant community of people working
together to build a world-class Node framework and tools. We value diversity of
individuals and opinions, and seek to operate on consensus whenever possible. We
strive to maintain a welcoming, inclusive, and harassment-free environment,
regardless of the form of communication. When consensus is not achievable, we
defer to the owners of each individual module; the powers of the individual
owner are kept in check by the ability of the community to fork and replace
dependencies on the individual module and maintainer.

## [Reporting issues](http://loopback.io/doc/en/contrib/Reporting-issues.html)

Issues in
[strongloop/loopback-next](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next/issues)
are the primary means by which bug reports and general discussions are made.
