# Maintaining LoopBack

Congratulations! Since you're reading this page, you are probably already a
maintainer of this repo or close to be one. Thank you for your contributions so
far!

## Why do I want to be a maintainer?

- Greater influence on LoopBack's future direction
- Commit (write) rights to `loopback-next` repo
- Ability to review and land pull requests, edit/categorize/close issues

## What are a maintainer's responsibilities?

We ask you to follow the existing processes, see
http://loopback.io/doc/en/contrib/Governance.html. This means mostly:

- Be nice to others
- Try to reach consensus with other maintainers before making a decision
- Always use pull requests to make code changes
- Honour our current conventions, see
  http://loopback.io/doc/en/contrib/triaging-pull-requests.html and
  http://loopback.io/doc/en/contrib/style-guide.html (but feel free to propose
  changes to these conventions!)
- To avoid possible confusion, we don't have any specific requirements about the
  amount of time you should spend on the project - just keep working on things
  that you find important to you, in a pace that suits you. We may ask you to
  take a look at issues and pull requests related to code you contributed
  yourself.

## More questions?

**Q: Now that I have rights to merge pull requests, how many approvals from
other maintainers before I can merge?**

A: If the changes are straightforward and you're confident about the changes,
please go ahead to merge it. Otherwise you can always mention
[@strongloop/loopback-maintainers](https://github.com/orgs/strongloop/teams/loopback-maintainers)
in the GitHub issues/pull requests.

**Q: If I have questions/suggestions on the contribution process, what should I
do?**

A: We are always open for suggestions on how to make the process for
contributors or maintainers smooth. If you have any feedback, please open a
GitHub ticket for discussion.
