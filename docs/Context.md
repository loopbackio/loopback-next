## What is Context?

- An abstraction of all state and dependencies in your application.
- Context is what LoopBack uses to "manage" everything.
- A global registry for anything/everything in your app (all configs, state,
dependencies, classes, etc).
- An [inversion of control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_of_control) container used to inject dependencies into your code. container used to inject dependencies into your code.

### Why is it important?

- You can use the context as a way to give loopback more "info" so that other
dependencies in your app may retrieve it (ie. a centralized place/global
builtin/in-memory storage mechanism).
- LoopBack can help "manage" your resources automatically (through
[Dependency Injection](Dependency-injection.md) and decorators).
- You have full access to updated/real-time application+request state at all
times.

## How to create a context?

A context can be created with an optional parent and an optional name. If the
name is not provided, a UUID will be generated as the value. Context instances
can be chained using the `parent` to form a hierarchy. For example, the code
below creates a chain of three contexts: `reqCtx -> serverCtx -> rootCtx`.

```ts
import {Context} from '@loopback/context';
const rootCtx = new Context('root-ctx'); // No parent
const serverCtx = new Context(rootCtx, 'server-ctx'); // rootCtx as the parent
const reqCtx = new Context(serverCtx); // No explicit name, a UUID will be generated
```

LoopBack's context system allows an unlimited amount of Context instances,
each of which may have a parent Context. However, an application typically
has three "levels" of context: application-level, server-level and request-level.

## Application-level context (global)

- stores all the initial and modified app state throughout the entire life of
the app (while the process is alive)
- Generally configured when the application is created (though other things may
modify things in the context while alive/running)

Here is a simple example:

```js
const Application = require('@loopback/core').Application;
// Please note `Application` extends from `Context`
const app = new Application(); // `app` is a "Context"
class MyController { ... }
app.controller(MyController);
```

In this case, you are using the `.controller` helper method to register a new
controller. The important point to note is `MyController` is actually registered
into the Application Context (`app` is a Context).

## Server-level context

Server-level context:
- Is a child of application-level context
- Holds configuration specific to a particular server instance

Your application will typically contain one or more server instances, each of
which will have the application-level context as its parent. This means that
any bindings that are defined on the application will also be available to the
server(s), unless you replace these bindings on the server instance(s) directly.

For example, [`@loopback/rest`](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next/blob/master/packages/rest)
has the `RestServer` class, which sets up a running HTTP/S server on a port, as
well as defining routes on that server for a REST API. To set the port binding
for the `RestServer`, you would bind the `RestBindings.PORT` key to a number.

We can selectively re-bind this value for certain server instances to change
what port they use:

```js
async start() {
  // publicApi will use port 443, since it inherits this binding from the app.
  app.bind(RestBindings.PORT).to(443);
  const publicApi = await app.getServer('public');
  const privateApi = await app.getServer('private');
  // privateApi will be bound to 8080 instead.
  privateApi.bind(RestBindings.PORT).to(8080);
  await super.start();
}
```

## Request-level context (request)

Using [`@loopback/rest`](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next/blob/master/packages/rest) as an
example, we can create custom sequences that:
- are dynamically created for each incoming server request
- extend the application level context (to give you access to application level dependencies during the request/response lifecycle)
- are garbage collected once the response is sent (memory management)

Let's see this in action:

```js
class MySequence extends DefaultSequence {
  handle(request, response) { // we provide these value for convenience (taken from the Context)
    // but they are still available in the sequence/request context
    const req = await this.ctx.get('rest.http.request');
    this.send(`hello ${req.params.name}`);
  }
}
```

- `this.ctx` is available to your sequence
- allows you to craft your response using resources from the app in addition to
the resources available to the request in real-time (right when you need it)
- `getSync` is one way to get stuff out of the context, there are many others,
see below

## Storing and retrieving items from a Context

Items in the Context are indexed via a key and bound to a `ContextValue`.
A `ContextKey` is simply a string value and is used to look up whatever you
store along with the key. For example:

```js
// app level
const app = new Application();
app.bind('hello').to('world'); // ContextKey='hello', ContextValue='world'
console.log(app.getSync('hello')); // => 'world'
```

In this case, we bind the 'world' string ContextValue to the 'hello' ContextKey.
When we fetch the ContextValue via `getSync`, we give it the ContextKey and it
returns the ContextValue that was initially bound (we can do other fancy things
too -- ie. instantiate your classes, etc)

The process of registering a ContextValue into the Context is known as
_binding_. Sequence-level bindings work the same way (shown 2 examples before).

For a list of the available functions you can use for binding, visit
the [Context API Docs](http://apidocs.loopback.io/@loopback%2fcontext).

## Dependency injection

- Many configs are adding to the Context during app instantiation/boot time by you/developer.
- When things are registered, the Context provides a way to use your
dependencies during runtime.

How you access these things is via low level helpers like `app.getSync` or the
`sequence` class that is provided to you as shown in the example in the previous
section.

However, when using classes, LoopBack provides a better way to get at stuff in
the context via the `@inject` decorator:

```ts
import {inject} from '@loopback/context';
import {Application} from '@loopback/core';
const app = new Application();
const app.bind('defaultName').to('John');

class HelloController {
  constructor(@inject('defaultName') name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
  greet(name) {
    return `Hello ${name || this.name}`;
  }
}
```

Notice we just use the default name as though it were available to the
constructor. Context allows LoopBack to give you the necessary information at
runtime even if you do not know the value when writing up the Controller.
The above will print `Hello John` at run time.

Please refer to [Dependency injection](Dependency-injection.md) for further
details.

## Context metadata and sugar decorators

Other interesting decorators can be used to help give LoopBack hints to
additional metadata you may want to provide in order to automatically set things
up. For example, let's take the previous example and make it available on the
`GET /greet` route using decorators provided by
[`@loopback/rest`](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next/blob/master/packages/rest):

```ts
class HelloController {
  // tell LoopBack you want this controller method
  // to be available at the GET /greet route
  @get('/greet')
  greet(
    // tell LoopBack you want to accept
    // the name parameter as a string from
    // the query string
    @param.query.string('name')
    name: string) {
    return `Hello ${name}`;
  }
}
```

These "sugar" decorators allow you to quickly build up your application without
having to code up all the additional logic by simply giving LoopBack hints
(in the form of metadata) to your intent.
