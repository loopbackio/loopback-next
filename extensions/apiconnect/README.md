# @loopback/apiconnect

This module extends LoopBack with the ability to integrate with
[IBM API Connect](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/api-connect). It comes with an
`ApiConnectComponent` that adds an `OASEnhencer` extension to contribute
`x-ibm-configuration` to the OpenAPI spec generated by LoopBack applications.

## Stability: ⚠️Experimental⚠️

> Experimental packages provide early access to advanced or experimental
> functionality to get community feedback. Such modules are published to npm
> using `0.x.y` versions. Their APIs and functionality may be subject to
> breaking changes in future releases.

## Installation

```sh
npm i @loopback/apiconnect --save
```

## Usage

The component should be loaded in the constructor of your custom Application
class.

Start by importing the component class:

```ts
import {ApiConnectComponent} from '@loopback/apiconnect';
```

In the constructor, add the component to your application:

```ts
this.component(ApiConnectComponent);
```

The component requires a configuration for API Connect extension for OpenAPI
spec. The `targetUrl` tells API Connect gateway where the REST APIs are served.

```ts
const apiConnectOptions: ApiConnectSpecOptions = {
  targetUrl: 'http://localhost:3000/test-service',
};
app
  .configure(ApiConnectBindings.API_CONNECT_SPEC_ENHANCER)
  .to(apiConnectOptions);
```
