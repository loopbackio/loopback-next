# labs

This directory contains experimental packages for LoopBack 4. It serves as
incubation labs to build features that are not production ready but we would
like to publish to npm as alpha quality releases (using `0.x.y` versioning
scheme). See [LABS.md](../LABS.md) to understand how experimental features are
developed, released, and graduated.
